 <p><strong>MI CORE SMP</strong> is a unique Minecraft server (SMP) where <strong>every player’s journey is their
    own</strong>. With <strong>fully customizable powers and abilities tied to your character, skin, and
    playstyle</strong>, no two adventures are alike. Whether you’re a swift rogue, a mighty tank, or a masterful
    mage, the <strong>possibilities are endless</strong>. Face off against <strong>powerful custom bosses</strong>,
    search for <strong>new ores</strong>, collect <strong>exclusive gear</strong>, and explore a world rich with
    challenges and opportunities. <strong>Originally created for animators</strong>, MI CORE SMP has now opened its
    doors to <strong>all Minecraft players</strong>, offering a vibrant community for fighters, builders, and
    adventurers alike. 
 </p>
 <p><strong>Journey starts here—are you ready to write your story?</strong></p>
 <h2 id="origins">Origins</h2>
 <p>The concept originated in <strong>February 2024</strong> with an RPG game idea called <strong>&quot;MI
    Core,&quot;</strong> which focused on <strong>custom abilities tailored to each character</strong>. Separately,
    by <strong>May 2024</strong>, a <strong>Minecraft server</strong> was created as a <strong>birthday party
    space</strong> for my friends and me.

 <p>Over time, it transitioned into an <strong>SMP</strong> with over 50 members, retaining the original concept of
    character-based abilities, hence the name. 
 </p>
 <p>This SMP was initially designed for <strong>animators</strong>, allowing them to bring their <strong>characters&#39;
    powers</strong> from animations into Minecraft. However, on <strong>June 4th</strong>, the first
    <strong>non-animator</strong> player, Pigbox, joined, marking a turning point and expanding the idea to a broader,
    <strong>community-driven base</strong>.

    <summary>I. Added Mithricore (Custom NEW Ore) & LORE (The Nether Heart)</summary>
    <h1 id="lore---the-nethers-heart-a-source-of-awe-and-fear">Lore - The Nether&#39;s Heart: A Source of Awe and Fear
    </h1>
    <p>Deep in the Nether’s molten core lies a myth whispered among ancient scholars and surviving Piglins: the
       <strong>Nether&#39;s Heart</strong>. A relic of unimaginable power, it is said to be the remnant of the Nether’s
       original <strong>fusion core</strong>, a primordial engine of creation that once sustained the realm. Now
       fractured and hidden, the Heart’s shards have scattered throughout the Nether, forming <strong>Mithrilite
       Corestone</strong>. But even as these fragments radiate immense power, they are but a faint echo of the
       Heart’s terrifying might. 
    </p>
    <h2 id="the-whispering-core">The Whispering Core</h2>
    <p>Those who dare to delve too deep in search of Mithrilite Corestone speak of strange phenomena. As miners approach
       rich veins, the very air seems to hum, vibrating with an unsettling resonance. Shadows flicker unnaturally, and
       faint whispers can be heard over the roar of lava, as if the Nether itself were alive and warning intruders.
    </p>
    <p>Some believe these whispers are the Heart’s voice—its fractured consciousness reaching out, luring the greedy and
       the bold closer to their doom. Others claim the Heart is no longer sentient but a <strong>force of pure
       chaos</strong>, its fragments eager to return to their original form, no matter the cost. 
    </p>
    <h2 id="the-nethers-pulse">The Nether&#39;s Pulse</h2>
    <p>Legends say that when too much <strong>Mithrilite Corestone</strong> is gathered in one place, the Heart reacts.
       Miners have reported sudden bursts of searing heat, even in areas devoid of lava. Others speak of
       “Netherquakes”—violent tremors that open fissures of molten rock, swallowing entire expeditions. Piglins, who
       revere the Heart as a divine force, warn against provoking its wrath, believing that mining too greedily could
       awaken something ancient and malevolent. 
    </p>
    <h2 id="the-slumbering-power">The Slumbering Power</h2>
    <p>If the Heart were to be reassembled, the consequences are uncertain but terrifying. Some speculate that it would
       reignite the Nether, transforming it into a realm of boundless energy and unimaginable beauty. But others warn
       of a darker fate: the Heart could unleash an uncontrollable wave of destruction, collapsing the Nether into a
       singularity and dragging the Overworld with it. 
    </p>
    <h2 id="a-reckless-gamble">A Reckless Gamble</h2>
    <p>The Nether&#39;s Heart is both a curse and a blessing. Its shards, the <strong>Mithrilite Corestones</strong>,
       provide unmatched power when refined, but each piece brings the world closer to a terrible gamble. If someone
       were to reforge the Heart—whether by accident or design—there is no guarantee that they would control it.
       Instead, they may become its first victim, consumed by the very energy they sought to command. 
    </p>
    <h2 id="final-warning">Final Warning</h2>
    <p>&quot;Beware the Heart,&quot; say the Piglins. &quot;For the Nether does not forget, and it does not
       forgive.&quot; 
    </p>
    <h1 id="processing-mithrilite-corestone-unlocking-the-nethers-power">Processing Mithrilite Corestone: Unlocking the
       Nether’s Power
    </h1>
    <p>The journey of <strong>Mithrilite Corestone</strong> from raw ore to ultimate resource reflects the intricate art
       of harnessing the Nether’s energy. Each step requires precision, skill, and a measure of bravery, as working
       with such a volatile material can lead to unforeseen consequences.
    </p>
    <h2 id="1-mining-mithrilite-corestone"><strong>1. Mining Mithrilite Corestone</strong></h2>
    <p>Found deep within the Nether’s dangerous landscapes, <strong>Mithrilite Corestone</strong> is one of the rarest
       ores in existence. It can only be mined with a <strong>diamond pickaxe or better</strong>, and its deposits are
       often surrounded by hostile mobs or buried within treacherous lava lakes. 
    </p>
    <p>When mined, the ore itself appears unassuming, but when exposed to extreme heat, its true nature begins to reveal
       itself.
    </p>
    <h2 id="2-smelting-into-mithrilite-core-dust"><strong>2. Smelting into Mithrilite Core Dust</strong></h2>
    <p>Mithrilite Corestone is smelted in a furnace or blast furnace to produce <strong>Mithrilite Core Dust</strong>.
       This shimmering, crystalline powder is the essence of the Corestone’s energy, concentrated into a more
       manageable form. Handling the dust is said to feel warm, almost alive, as if it holds the Nether’s heartbeat
       within. 
    </p>

       alt="Smelting into Mithrilite Core Dust"></p>
    <h2 id="3-forging-forged-coreshards"><strong>3. Forging Forged Coreshards</strong></h2>
    <p>Using a crafting table, <strong>Mithrilite Core Dust</strong> can be fused and compressed into <strong>Forged
       Coreshards</strong>. This process mimics the ancient fusion reactions of the Nether’s core, requiring skill
       and determination to complete. 
    </p>
    <ul>
       <li>Forged Coreshards are metallic and unyielding, imbued with the Nether’s primal energy. </li>
       <li>These shards are highly sought after, as they are the foundation for creating the strongest tools, armor,

    <p>Forged Coreshards can also be used to craft the <strong>Block of Mithricore</strong>, a solidified monument to
       the ore’s power. This block is not only unburnable and resistant to explosions but also serves as a
       <strong>beacon base</strong>, amplifying the effects of beacons when used. 
    </p>
    <ul>
       <li>Its surface is sleek and metallic, with glowing runes that pulse faintly. </li>
       <li>Placing a Block of Mithricore in a structure makes it nearly indestructible, perfect for fortresses or
          treasures.

    <h2 id="the-risk-of-harnessing-power">The Risk of Harnessing Power</h2>
    <p>While the process of transforming <strong>Mithrilite Corestone</strong> into its refined forms is rewarding, it
       is not without danger. Mishandling the material at any stage—mining, smelting, or forging—can trigger unstable
       reactions, releasing bursts of energy or attracting hostile mobs. Players are warned to proceed with caution, as
       even the smallest mistake could have devastating consequences.
    </p>
    <p>The power of <strong>Mithrilite Corestone</strong> is immense, but so too are the risks that come with wielding
       it. Only those with the courage to face the Nether’s trials will unlock the full potential of this extraordinary
       resource.

    <p>Netherite seemed to me, as quite an overpowered resource that could be gained in quite a less amount of time. And
       with Mithricore already added, Netherite didn&#39;t really feel a place here.

       alt="Glarciaron_Promotional_Render"></p>
    <p>In the frozen void of the <strong>Frostspire Wastes</strong>, an ancient glacier gave rise to the terrifying
       <strong>Glarciaron</strong>. Created by a vanished civilization to protect their land from disaster, it was
       imbued with the <strong>essence of eternal winter</strong>—granting it immense strength, intelligence, and an
       unbreakable bond to the ice it guarded. 
    </p>
    <p>When the civilization disappeared, <strong>Glarciaron</strong> remained, a <strong>silent sentinel</strong>
       wandering the tundra. Its presence was heralded by <strong>violent snowstorms</strong>, but it never attacked
       unless provoked. Over time, it became a <strong>feared legend</strong>, believed to be the <strong>last
       protector of ancient secrets</strong> buried beneath the ice. 
    </p>
    <p>Yet <strong>Glarciaron</strong> is more than a mere guardian. Its <strong>frozen core</strong> holds
       <strong>forbidden knowledge</strong> and <strong>immense power</strong>. As the land begins to thaw, the
       creature stirs, sensing the disturbance of its delicate world. It views any who enter the
       <strong>Wastes</strong> as potential threats, but it will not act unless pushed. 
    </p>
    <p>Provoking <strong>Glarciaron</strong> is a mistake. Once angered, it summons the <strong>fury of winter</strong>,
       unleashing <strong>blizzards</strong> that freeze the blood in its enemies’ veins. Its fists crash like
       <strong>glaciers</strong>, shattering bones with each blow. But its most terrifying ability is the power to
       <strong>launch foes into the sky</strong>. With a brutal motion, <strong>Glarciaron</strong> conjures a
       <strong>vortex of freezing winds</strong>, sending its prey <strong>thousands of feet into the air</strong>. The
       cold tears through their flesh, <strong>freezing it solid</strong>, cracking bones, and rupturing veins. When
       they fall, their bodies shatter—<strong>limbs snap</strong>, <strong>blood bursts</strong>, and the ground
       becomes a <strong>frozen grave</strong>. 
    </p>
    <p>Only the <strong>toughest</strong> can survive the <strong>Frost Guardian’s wrath</strong>. If they do, they will
       earn the <strong>IceBound Boots</strong>—relics from a forgotten age, pulsing with <strong>dark power</strong>.
       These boots grant <strong>incredible speed</strong> and the <strong>ability to walk on water</strong>, leaving a
       chilling trail of frost behind. 
    </p>
    <p>But beware: disturb the balance, and <strong>Glarciaron</strong> will rise again—<strong>hungrier and more savage
       than ever</strong>.
    </p>
    <h1 id="take-upon-the-challenge---fighting-this-beast">Take upon the Challenge - Fighting this Beast</h1>
    <p>To spawn Glarciaron, players must craft the Glarciaron Spawn Egg.</p>

    <p>When <strong>Glarciaron</strong> falls, it drops four rare <strong>Ice Chunks</strong>, crystallized fragments of
       its frozen core infused with its ancient power. These chunks, glowing faintly with the essence of eternal
       winter, are essential for crafting the legendary <strong>IceBound Boots</strong>. Players must collect all four
       and combine them with other materials at a crafting table to forge the boots. Once crafted, the <strong>IceBound
       Boots</strong> grant incredible speed and the ability to freeze water beneath the wearer’s feet, creating a
       frosty path wherever they go. These icy relics are a testament to the wielder’s triumph over the Frost Guardian,
       holding both its strength and a reminder of the perilous battle it took to earn them.

    <p>Make sure that <strong>these graves are deleted upon server restart</strong>, meaning you <strong>must collect

       everything inside it. So be sure to retrieve your belongings promptly to avoid losing them forever!

       dynamic feel to combat. The size of the splatter increases with stronger attacks, and these effects can interact
       with the environment, leaving marks on the ground and nearby blocks, adding a layer of detail to each encounter.
       Don&#39;t worry about the lag, these splatters automatically disappear after a short amount of time.

       alt="Blood Splatter"></p>
    <p>As mobs take damage, their appearance gradually changes, with their skin becoming more <strong>bloodied</strong>
       and <strong>distressed</strong>. This visual cue helps players track the toll the battle is taking on their
       opponent, creating a more immersive experience as the mob&#39;s condition worsens.

    <h2 id="custom-itemsabilitiespowers-inside-of-mi-core">Custom Items/Abilities/Powers inside of MI CORE</h2>
    <p>In <strong>MI CORE SMP</strong>, players can submit their custom <strong>item</strong>, <strong>power</strong>,
       or <strong>ability</strong> requests based on their in-game <strong>skin</strong> or <strong>character
       design</strong> via the official Discord server. If the request is fair and aligns with the theme of the
       server, I will do my best to bring it to life within Minecraft. The idea is to make sure that the requested
       abilities or items connect to the player&#39;s <strong>skin</strong> or <strong>character</strong> in a
       meaningful way—whether through <strong>appearance, traits, or backstory</strong>. This makes each request unique
       and immersive, allowing everyone to experience the power or item that best suits their persona in the world of
       MI CORE SMP. If you have a cool idea or want to enhance your character, don&#39;t hesitate to share it!
