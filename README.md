**MI CORE SMP** is a unique Minecraft server (SMP) where **every player’s journey is their own**. With **fully customizable powers and abilities tied to your character, skin, and playstyle**, no two adventures are alike. Whether you’re a swift rogue, a mighty tank, or a masterful mage, the **possibilities are endless**. Face off against **powerful custom bosses**, search for **new ores**, collect **exclusive gear**, and explore a world rich with challenges and opportunities. **Originally created for animators**, MI CORE SMP has now opened its doors to **all Minecraft players**, offering a vibrant community for fighters, builders, and adventurers alike. 

**Journey starts here—are you ready to write your story?**


## Origins

The concept originated in **February 2024** with an RPG game idea called **"MI Core,"** which focused on **custom abilities tailored to each character**. Separately, by **May 2024**, a **Minecraft server** was created as a **birthday party space** for my friends and me.

</details>

Over time, it transitioned into an **SMP** with over 50 members, retaining the original concept of character-based abilities, hence the name. 

This SMP was initially designed for **animators**, allowing them to bring their **characters' powers** from animations into Minecraft. However, on **June 4th**, the first **non-animator** player, Pigbox, joined, marking a turning point and expanding the idea to a broader, **community-driven base**.

When **Season 1** concluded, **Season 2**, started as a banger, opened its doors to **all Minecraft players**. Unfortunately, due to a lack of proper promotion, Season 2 fell into obscurity.

<details>

<summary>I. Added Mithricore (Custom NEW Ore) & LORE (The Nether Heart)</summary>

# Lore - The Nether's Heart: A Source of Awe and Fear  

Deep in the Nether’s molten core lies a myth whispered among ancient scholars and surviving Piglins: the **Nether's Heart**. A relic of unimaginable power, it is said to be the remnant of the Nether’s original **fusion core**, a primordial engine of creation that once sustained the realm. Now fractured and hidden, the Heart’s shards have scattered throughout the Nether, forming **Mithrilite Corestone**. But even as these fragments radiate immense power, they are but a faint echo of the Heart’s terrifying might.  

## The Whispering Core  
Those who dare to delve too deep in search of Mithrilite Corestone speak of strange phenomena. As miners approach rich veins, the very air seems to hum, vibrating with an unsettling resonance. Shadows flicker unnaturally, and faint whispers can be heard over the roar of lava, as if the Nether itself were alive and warning intruders.  

Some believe these whispers are the Heart’s voice—its fractured consciousness reaching out, luring the greedy and the bold closer to their doom. Others claim the Heart is no longer sentient but a **force of pure chaos**, its fragments eager to return to their original form, no matter the cost.  

## The Nether's Pulse  
Legends say that when too much **Mithrilite Corestone** is gathered in one place, the Heart reacts. Miners have reported sudden bursts of searing heat, even in areas devoid of lava. Others speak of “Netherquakes”—violent tremors that open fissures of molten rock, swallowing entire expeditions. Piglins, who revere the Heart as a divine force, warn against provoking its wrath, believing that mining too greedily could awaken something ancient and malevolent.  

## The Slumbering Power  
If the Heart were to be reassembled, the consequences are uncertain but terrifying. Some speculate that it would reignite the Nether, transforming it into a realm of boundless energy and unimaginable beauty. But others warn of a darker fate: the Heart could unleash an uncontrollable wave of destruction, collapsing the Nether into a singularity and dragging the Overworld with it.   

## A Reckless Gamble  
The Nether's Heart is both a curse and a blessing. Its shards, the **Mithrilite Corestones**, provide unmatched power when refined, but each piece brings the world closer to a terrible gamble. If someone were to reforge the Heart—whether by accident or design—there is no guarantee that they would control it. Instead, they may become its first victim, consumed by the very energy they sought to command.  

## Final Warning  
"Beware the Heart," say the Piglins. "For the Nether does not forget, and it does not forgive."  


# Processing Mithrilite Corestone: Unlocking the Nether’s Power  

The journey of **Mithrilite Corestone** from raw ore to ultimate resource reflects the intricate art of harnessing the Nether’s energy. Each step requires precision, skill, and a measure of bravery, as working with such a volatile material can lead to unforeseen consequences.


## **1. Mining Mithrilite Corestone**  
Found deep within the Nether’s dangerous landscapes, **Mithrilite Corestone** is one of the rarest ores in existence. It can only be mined with a **diamond pickaxe or better**, and its deposits are often surrounded by hostile mobs or buried within treacherous lava lakes.  

When mined, the ore itself appears unassuming, but when exposed to extreme heat, its true nature begins to reveal itself.

## **2. Smelting into Mithrilite Core Dust**  
Mithrilite Corestone is smelted in a furnace or blast furnace to produce **Mithrilite Core Dust**. This shimmering, crystalline powder is the essence of the Corestone’s energy, concentrated into a more manageable form. Handling the dust is said to feel warm, almost alive, as if it holds the Nether’s heartbeat within. 

![Smelting into Mithrilite Core Dust](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1308803757596737580/1310842008717496381/NewFurnaceGUI.gif?ex=6746b041&is=67455ec1&hm=ca71e153fd15ac9ff3d4b98865b18f90551212747fcce5bfec259d37b3393fbe&)

## **3. Forging Forged Coreshards**  
Using a crafting table, **Mithrilite Core Dust** can be fused and compressed into **Forged Coreshards**. This process mimics the ancient fusion reactions of the Nether’s core, requiring skill and determination to complete.  
- Forged Coreshards are metallic and unyielding, imbued with the Nether’s primal energy.  
- These shards are highly sought after, as they are the foundation for creating the strongest tools, armor, and structures in the game.
  
![Forging Forged Coreshards](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1308803757596737580/1310842114556559410/GUI_Crafting_Table.png?ex=6746b05a&is=67455eda&hm=86e9a7b5de3c61e8be3f5dba715bde4c7bb55ee6640c6e93ba244cb1a87ddf37&)

## **4. Crafting Mithricored Gear**  
Forged Coreshards are the key to **Mithricored tools and armor**, the most powerful equipment in existence. Each item crafted with Forged Coreshards is infused with durability and strength, surpassing even Netherite.  
- **Mithricored Sword**: Cuts through enemies with unparalleled sharpness and speed.  
- **Mithricored Pickaxe**: Mines faster than any other tool, capable of breaking even the toughest blocks.  
- **Mithricored Armor**: Provides unmatched protection and resistance to damage, making the wearer nearly invincible.

![Mithricored Sword](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1308803757596737580/1310842293011349555/Screenshot_2024-11-26_104540-removebg-preview_1.png?ex=6746b084&is=67455f04&hm=e6676bc083b810bb05187e8a96467389ef64a3f190fcd3f50bb7ce970427e00e&) 
![Mithricored Armor](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1308803757596737580/1310842196001292328/GUI_Crafting_Table_1.png?ex=6746b06d&is=67455eed&hm=d0b7897033f3779b69f2c72926ae199b8a71e03785a4c56a42cedc0a32fe6237&)

This gear is not only practical but a status symbol, showing the world that the player has conquered the Nether’s challenges.


## **5. Crafting the Block of Mithricore**  
Forged Coreshards can also be used to craft the **Block of Mithricore**, a solidified monument to the ore’s power. This block is not only unburnable and resistant to explosions but also serves as a **beacon base**, amplifying the effects of beacons when used.  
- Its surface is sleek and metallic, with glowing runes that pulse faintly.  
- Placing a Block of Mithricore in a structure makes it nearly indestructible, perfect for fortresses or treasures.  


## The Risk of Harnessing Power  
While the process of transforming **Mithrilite Corestone** into its refined forms is rewarding, it is not without danger. Mishandling the material at any stage—mining, smelting, or forging—can trigger unstable reactions, releasing bursts of energy or attracting hostile mobs. Players are warned to proceed with caution, as even the smallest mistake could have devastating consequences.

The power of **Mithrilite Corestone** is immense, but so too are the risks that come with wielding it. Only those with the courage to face the Nether’s trials will unlock the full potential of this extraordinary resource.

<summary>II. Removed Netherite</summary>


Netherite seemed to me, as quite an overpowered resource that could be gained in quite a less amount of time. And with Mithricore already added, Netherite didn't really feel a place here.


</details>

<details>

<summary>III. Added Glarciaron (Custom NEW Boss)</summary>

# The Glarciaron - Lore

![Glarciaron_Promotional_Render](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1309489058761674771/1311199143443566632/Glaciaron_Promotional_Render.png?ex=6747fcdc&is=6746ab5c&hm=91f31d97ca75726c0493ffc9e0ff0e77676fc258e9675b0a6b69f476d3f6de78&)

In the frozen void of the **Frostspire Wastes**, an ancient glacier gave rise to the terrifying **Glarciaron**. Created by a vanished civilization to protect their land from disaster, it was imbued with the **essence of eternal winter**—granting it immense strength, intelligence, and an unbreakable bond to the ice it guarded.  

When the civilization disappeared, **Glarciaron** remained, a **silent sentinel** wandering the tundra. Its presence was heralded by **violent snowstorms**, but it never attacked unless provoked. Over time, it became a **feared legend**, believed to be the **last protector of ancient secrets** buried beneath the ice.  

Yet **Glarciaron** is more than a mere guardian. Its **frozen core** holds **forbidden knowledge** and **immense power**. As the land begins to thaw, the creature stirs, sensing the disturbance of its delicate world. It views any who enter the **Wastes** as potential threats, but it will not act unless pushed.  

Provoking **Glarciaron** is a mistake. Once angered, it summons the **fury of winter**, unleashing **blizzards** that freeze the blood in its enemies’ veins. Its fists crash like **glaciers**, shattering bones with each blow. But its most terrifying ability is the power to **launch foes into the sky**. With a brutal motion, **Glarciaron** conjures a **vortex of freezing winds**, sending its prey **thousands of feet into the air**. The cold tears through their flesh, **freezing it solid**, cracking bones, and rupturing veins. When they fall, their bodies shatter—**limbs snap**, **blood bursts**, and the ground becomes a **frozen grave**.  

Only the **toughest** can survive the **Frost Guardian’s wrath**. If they do, they will earn the **IceBound Boots**—relics from a forgotten age, pulsing with **dark power**. These boots grant **incredible speed** and the **ability to walk on water**, leaving a chilling trail of frost behind.  

But beware: disturb the balance, and **Glarciaron** will rise again—**hungrier and more savage than ever**.

# Take upon the Challenge - Fighting this Beast

To spawn Glarciaron, players must craft the Glarciaron Spawn Egg.

![Fighting this Beast](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1309489058761674771/1311326705025024020/GUI_Crafting_Table.png?ex=674873a9&is=67472229&hm=63c4ba2294b5fed3b0815b7f20efd378b2bdfb177ab3f06cdfe11574e45796ea&)

# Rewards of the Icy Conqueror

When **Glarciaron** falls, it drops four rare **Ice Chunks**, crystallized fragments of its frozen core infused with its ancient power. These chunks, glowing faintly with the essence of eternal winter, are essential for crafting the legendary **IceBound Boots**. Players must collect all four and combine them with other materials at a crafting table to forge the boots. Once crafted, the **IceBound Boots** grant incredible speed and the ability to freeze water beneath the wearer’s feet, creating a frosty path wherever they go. These icy relics are a testament to the wielder’s triumph over the Frost Guardian, holding both its strength and a reminder of the perilous battle it took to earn them.
